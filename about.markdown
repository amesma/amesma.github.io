I am a biomedical engineer specializing in medical device product development. I primarily work with systems and human factors engineering, but also have experience with UX research as it pertains to medtech. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Masters in Translational Medicine (go Bears!) and from UCLA with a Bachelor's in Cognitive Science with a minor in Bioinformatics (go Bruins!). While I love to solve technical problems and work with my hands in the lab, I am also passionate about what users and patients need. My research interests include addressing public health inequities, HIV treatment and prevention, and rapid IVD assays. Outside of the biomedical sciences, I love building IKEA furniture and propagating my plants.
